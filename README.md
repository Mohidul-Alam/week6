# Colorful Journey Webpage

This project contains a single-page HTML document that creates a visually engaging scrolling experience. As the user scrolls down the page, they are taken through a story with sections that transition smoothly, each highlighting a different color and part of the narrative.

## Features

- Full viewport height sections that fill the screen.
- Smooth background color transitions between sections.
- Text animations that bring the story to life as you scroll.
- Responsive design for various display sizes.
- Utilizes Google Fonts for enhanced typography.

## How to Use

To use this webpage, simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. Scroll down to activate the animations and experience the story.

## Customization

You can customize the story, colors, and animations by editing the HTML and CSS within the `index.html` file. The sections are marked with comments to indicate where each part of the story begins and ends.

## Fonts Used

- Lora for headings
- Roboto for body text

These fonts are included via Google Fonts and can be changed if desired by modifying the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section of the HTML document.

## Browser Compatibility
